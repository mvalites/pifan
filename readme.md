## About
This is an initial checkin of some stuff I was playing around with because my Pi was overheating a bit.   

It makes use of a simple circuit and the GPIO pins to run a small fan
 
## TODO
- Figure out the fan curve stuff.   Currently very hacky
- Ensure we're idiomatically correct in our Golan
- Schematic for fan
